# Nobiru

Nobiru is supposed to be a toy environment where I can
learn more about the algorithms that power Machine Learning and Deep Learning by implementing them myself.

This site is basically a well-formatted version of my study notes.

## Deep Learning

The basic blocks for building neural networks are provided by the [**nn**](./nn/index.md) module
which API is loosely modelled after **PyTorch**'s.
